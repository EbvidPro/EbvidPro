### Glad to see you here!  
Nice to meet you! I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and am interested in a variety of technologies and topics. I am a passionate, self-motivated learner. I love learning, discovering new things and I love anything tech. I am very comfortable with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, Git and Github, React.js and many others. I'm a big productivity and minimalism freak, and I'm constantly reading up on or trying out productivity hacks in an attempt to live a more balanced and thoughtful life. 

I love to solve problems, highly teachable and ready to acquire new abilities, enjoyable to work with, have a strong work ethic, and, most importantly, I'm incredibly curious and ask a lot of questions!

I've always believed in giving back to the tech community, with a special emphasis on developing and supporting chances for people looking to begin a career in technology through mentoring and offering to help in any difficulty.
